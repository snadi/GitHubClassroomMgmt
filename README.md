# Scripts to manage GitHub Classroom

This folder contains scripts to collect assignments or labs and push feedback to student repositories in a given GitHub organization. There are no repository creation scripts here, since we use GitHub classroom for this part.



## Dependencies

- Python 3
- [github3](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py)

````shell
# Quick installation steps
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
````

These scripts have been tested with Python 3.9.1(latest).

## Instructions

To use these scripts, please follow the following steps:

1. **Add SSH keys to your GitHub account**

   - Follow the steps on this website: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

2. **Generate a personal access token**

   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens, click `Generate new token`, select all scopes and click `Generate token`.

   - Remember to copy the token and paste it to a file created by yourself named `token_file.txt`.

3. **Configure**

   - Open `config`, make your own configuration. Typically, you need to change `username`, `prefix` and `deadline`.
   - `prefix` is the name of lab or assignment you are grading (e.g., assignment1).
   - If you want to collect all repos, provide no value to key `list`. Otherwise, use `ccid_list.txt` as value.
   - If you want to collect repos with the latest commit, provide no value to key `deadline`. Otherwise, the script finds the closest commit that happens before a given deadline (inclusive) and clones/checks out the repository at that commit.

4. **Add ccids**

   - Fill `student_list.csv` with CCID-GitHubUsername pairs from the course.

   - Open `ccid_list.txt`, paste ccids you need to grade to this file.
   - All ccids are emails (e.g., zicun@ualberta.ca), one ccid per line.

5. **Collect repositories**

   ```shell
   # Run this command in the root directory.

   python3 collect_repos.py

   # If you are grading assignment1,
   # a directory called 'assignment1' will be created,
   # where all the repos for assignment1 will be cloned to.
   
   # At the end, the script will output some error messages 
   # including any ccid it couldn't find in the student list.
   ```

6. **Grade**

   - Run whatever grading scripts you have or grade manually and create a feedback file in each repository.

7. **Push feedback to student's repository**

   ```shell
   # If your feedback is in 'feedback.md', run this command in the root directory.

   ./push_feedback.sh feedback.md

   # This will go through all repos in the subdirectories (check directory structure above),
   # push every file named 'feedback.md' to corresponding repositories,
   # so to name all feedback files with the same name is a good move.

   # Because the collection process leaves the repository in a detached state,
   # this script will checkout main branch, pull with rebase, and push.
   ```

8. **Update repositories (optional)**

   - Because all labs of one student are in one repository, every time when we start grading a new lab, we need to assign a new value to `deadline` and run `python3 collect_repos.py`.
   - All repositories will be updated to the closest commit before the new deadline.

## Troubleshooting

1. **github3.py installation issuses**
  
   As described above, you need to install github3.py in order to use the scripts, and if it's your first time using the GitHub module on the lab machines, you may encounter the below errors when trying to install the github3 module:
   
   ```
   Command "/usr/bin/python3 -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-
   89vz819b/cryptography/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).
   read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-197ans87-record/
   install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --user --prefix=" failed 
   with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-89vz819b/cryptography/
   ```

   or

   ```
   Failed buidling wheel for cryptography
   ```

   Running the command below fixes the above errors, and then you'll be able to run the installation as descibed under `Quick Installation Steps`:

   ```
   pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

2. **ccid_list.txt and student_list.csv file issues**

   If your `ccid_list.txt` or `student_list.csv` files are improperly formatted, the scripts may run into a `KeyError` in execution. Make sure there isn't a trailing newline at the bottom of the file; you may need to open the `student_list.csv` file in a text editor rather than spreadsheet software to correct the formatting.
